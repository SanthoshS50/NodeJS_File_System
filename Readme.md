# NodeJS File System Task

This is the Task for Day_1 NodeJS

This application creates a web server on port 8000 with two endpoints. The root endpoint generates a text file in a folder named 'Current_TimeStamp' containing the current timestamp and sends its content as a response. The '/getTextFiles' endpoint retrieves and returns a list of all text files in the same folder.
